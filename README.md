# Kinect-YOLO-Depth-Web_Server

Real-time object detection and classification. Paper: version 1, version 2.

Read more about YOLO (in darknet) and download weight files here. In case the weight file cannot be found, I uploaded some of mine here, which include yolo-full and yolo-tiny of v1.0, tiny-yolo-v1.1 of v1.1 and yolo, tiny-yolo-voc of v2.

By following Miguel's lesson I was able to incorperate flask into my Kinect Yolo projects.
